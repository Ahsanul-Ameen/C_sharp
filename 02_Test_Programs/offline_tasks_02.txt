Task_01:  write a program which takes an integer number as input and prints its reverse value. It should be remembered that built-in string methods are illicit here. [hint: can you do it using a while loop]
sample IO: in: 12365
		   out: 56321
		   
		   in: -23453452
		   out: 25435432
		   
		   in: 11911
		   out: 11911
		   
		   
Task_02: write a program which initializes a char array of n random characters(considering only 0-9A-Za-z) and a character ch
and finds the indices of all occurance of ch in the array. In case of absence it should return -1. [hint: use linear search]
sample IO: in: {'a', 'n', 'N', '9', 'K'}, '9'
		   out:  3
		  
		   in: {'a', 'n', 'N', '9', 'K'}, '0'
		   out:  -1
		   
		   
Task_03: write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints its sorted version in non increasing order.[please don't use built-in sorting method] [hint: you may want to use bubble sort/selection sort/insertion sort, counting sort! etc]		   
sample IO: in: {99, -1, 0, -55, 68, 3453, 0}
		   out: {3453, 99, 68, 0, 0, -1, -55}
		  
		   in: {9880, 999, 100}
		   out: {9880, 999, 100}
		   
		  
Task_04: write a program that takes a sorted array of integers in non-decreasing order and a number & returns a boolean if the number is found in the array or not. [hint: use binary search]
sample IO: in: {-5, 7, 7, 9, 1005}, -5
		   out:  True
		  
		   in: {7, 7, 7, 7, 8}, 6
		   out:  False
		   
		   

		   
Task_05: Write a program which takes two string as input - a needle and a haystack. And find the number of occurance of the needle in the haystack.
sample_IO: in:  "poor", "A poor needle in haystack!"
		   out: 1
		   
		   in:  "noodle", "A poor needle in haystack!"
		   out: 0
		   
		   in:  " ", "A_poor needle in haystack!"
		   out: 3
		   
		   
Task_06: Write a program that takes a binary string as input and prints the equivalent decimal value.
sample_IO: in: 1000101
		   out: 69
		   
		   in: 10
		   out: 2
		   
		   in: 11111111111111111111111111111111
		   out: -1 (to be tested...)
		   
		  
Task_07: Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints the equivalent 32 bits long binary string[hint: use 2's complement form of integers & remember bitwise operators?]
sample_IO: in: 69
		   out: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 0101
		   
		   in: 2147483647
		   out: 0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
		   
		   
	
Task_08: Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and outputs its prefix sum array.
sample_IO: in: {4, 0, 5, -8, -3, 11, 20}
		   out: {4, 4, 9, 1, -2, 9, 29}
		   
		   in: {2, 2, 2, 2, 100, 0}
		   out: {2, 4, 6, 8, 108, 108}
		   
		   
Task_09: Write a program that takes an array of integers(at least lenght 2) as input and outputs second largest number.
sample_IO: in: {6, 7, 4, -45}
		   out: 6
		   
		   in: {-100, -55}
		   out: -100
		   
		   
		   
		   
Task_10: Write a program that prints a random greetings to you from one of the fours![you may want to use random numbers]
greetings: {"Tank You!" , "It's nice to meet you", "What’s new?", "What’s happenin'"}


out1:  What’s new?

out2: Tank You!

...
out3: What’s happenin'
