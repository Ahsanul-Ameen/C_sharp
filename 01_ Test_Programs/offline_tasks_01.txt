// general instructions: 
1. first try to understant the problem using pen & paper
2. then think of how to solve(example: using for loop and what not...)
3. try to code in a clean way
4. if fails, then google it
5. don't copy paste any code from internet without understandint it
6. try to tweak your code and see how it behaves
7. best of luck

//------------------------------------------Code it hard--------------------------------------------------------------
#Task_01: Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes a string as user input and output its reversed version.
	example: Input: "Dhaka" (withoud quotes)
			 Output: "akahD" (without quotes)
	hint: you may want to swap the first character with the last one, second char with the previous last one and so on.
			 
			 
			 
			 
#Task_02: Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes the value of an integer N as user input and prints a N by N grid as output.
	example: Input: 5
			 Output: #####
			 		 #####
			 		 #####
			 		 #####
			 		 #####
			 
			 		 		 		
			 		 
			 		 
#Task_03: Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes the value of an integer N as user input and prints a right-angle triangle as output.
	example: Input: 4
			 Output: #
			 		 ##
			 		 ###
			 		 ####
			 		 
			 
			 
			 		 
#Task_04: Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes the value of an integer N as user input and prints a right-angle triangle as output.
	example: Input: 4
			 Output:  ****
			 		   ***
			 		    **
			 		     *
			 		     
			 		     
			 		     
			 		     
#Task_05: Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes the value of an integer N as user input and prints a  triangle as output.
	example: Input: 5
			 Output:  	*			// line 1: 2 * 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1			 		    
			           ***				
			          *****
			         *******		// line 4: 2 * 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
			        *********
	hint: there are (2*i - 1) characters printed in line i
	
	
	
	
	
#Task_06:  Write a program(you may write a new method) which takes the value of an integer N as user input and output the sum of all natural numbers up to N.
	example: Input_1: 6
			 Output_1: 21     // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
			 
			 Input_2: 10
			 Output_2: 55
			 
			 
			 
			 
#Task_07: Write a program(you may write a new method) which prints the alphabets in a semi-triangular form as output.
	example: Output: a
			 		 bc
			 		 def
			 		 ghij
			 		 klmno
			 		 pqrstu
			 		 vwxyz
